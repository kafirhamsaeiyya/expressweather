# expressweather
> A weather application built in Express

## Motivation
I made this project just to demonstrate my node.js and calling to an API skills. I think it worked well.

## Technologies
I made this with Node.js, Express.js, and EJS.

## Source code

To launch the source code, make sure you have node.js installed. Then, type `node server.js` into the terminal, or command prompt to launch the application.
